# Logs-Management
Docker multiple containers logs management into one *.json file

## Scenario

1. We first build two `node.js` source files one for `sender.js` which sends message to server and another one is `server.js` server which runs on `port:3001`. 

## [Reference]()

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/) - official Docker documentation which shows how to make `image` file and run that particular image inside the `container`.
